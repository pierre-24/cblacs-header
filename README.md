# ScaLAPACKe: C headers and wrappers for scaLAPACK

Lastest version: [v0.2.3](https://github.com/pierre-24/scalapacke/releases/tag/v0.2.3), corresponding to [scaLAPACK v2.2.0](https://github.com/Reference-ScaLAPACK/scalapack/releases/tag/v2.2.0).

Provide a set of headers and wrappers in order to easily use [scaLAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/scalapack/) (and its components, [PBLAS](https://netlib.org/scalapack/pblas_qref.html) and [BLACS](https://netlib.org/blacs/)) in C.
Unlike [LAPACKe](https://netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html), **it is not a Fortran to C translation**, rather a set of lightweight wrappers.
