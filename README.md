# ScaLAPACKe C headers and wrappers

Provide a set of headers and wrappers in order to easily use [scaLAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/scalapack/) (and its components, [PBLAS](https://netlib.org/scalapack/pblas_qref.html) and [BLACS](https://netlib.org/blacs/)) in C.
The goal is to, as much as possible, automatically create these files from [the sources of the reference ScaLAPACK implementation](https://github.com/Reference-ScaLAPACK/scalapack/).
This should thus reflect the reference APIs.
