# About this project

**TL;DR:** This project, developed by [Pierre Beaujean](https://pierrebeaujean.net/), provide some C headers (that are missing in the [reference scaLAPACK implementation](https://www.netlib.org/scalapack/)) and wrappers (in the spirit of [LAPACKe](https://netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html)).

## What?

For more details on how to use scaLAPACKe in practice, see [this document](dev/quickstart.md).

## How?

If you are interested in that, maybe you want to help? If so, I'm happy to [welcome your contributions](contrib/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Who?

My name is [Pierre Beaujean](https://pierrebeaujean.net), and I'm a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry from the [University of Namur](https://unamur.be) (Belgium).
I'm the main (and only) developer of this project, used in our lab.
I'd like to use scaLAPACK(e) to overcome the memory limitation of a single computer node.

Note that I don't know any of the people at netlib, MKL, or others.
I'm not even a specialist in scaLAPACK, I just end up writing this project in order to comfortably use it in C.
I'm just a guy trying to help the world ;)
