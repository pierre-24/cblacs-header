# A gentle introduction to (sca)LAPACK(e)

!!! Info
    
    There are not a lot of info about scaLAPACK on the internet, except for some rare blog posts or stackoverflow questions.
    The most complete source of information is the [scaLAPACK user gide](https://netlib.org/scalapack/slug/index.html).

    Sadly, an extensive list of the functions provided by scaLAPACK is not easy to find (thought many of them are mentioned [in this section](https://netlib.org/scalapack/slug/node50.html) in the aformentioned document) and the "best" documentation to know the use of each argument is the [source code of the reference implementation](https://github.com/Reference-ScaLAPACK/scalapack) (which is probably not the best idea).
    That being said, this document tries to help you entering this (rather obscure?) world.
